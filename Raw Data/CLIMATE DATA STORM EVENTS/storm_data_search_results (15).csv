Snowfall totals at Snoqualmie Pass neared four and a half feet over 48 hours resulting in the pass being closed for over 72 hours for snow removal and avalanche mitigation. Just after the initial closure a fatal motor vehicle accident (indirect) occurred near Hyak when a tractor trailer crashed into a concrete barrier. Over 300 vehicles became stranded on the pass when the interstate was shut down. They were eventually led to safety on the 12th of February in a Washington State DOT and State Police convoy. Additional storm total snowfall accumulations of 38 inches at Trout Lake, 15 to 22 inches in the Columbia River Gorge, 8 to 12 inches in the Simcoe Highlands, 10 to 12 inches in the Northwest Blue Mountains and 4 to 6 inches in the Blue Mountain foothills were recorded.",1
