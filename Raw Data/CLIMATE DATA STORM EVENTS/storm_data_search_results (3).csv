The event took place when a combination of unseasonably strong jet stream winds, a cold front from the northwest and high pressure from Canada built southward.  Most notably, the windstorm caused millions of dollars in damage to fruit trees in the Okanogan Valley, where approximately 45,000 bins of maturing apples and pears were blown off trees.  Much more fruit was damaged but left on the tree.  Many other trees were blown over altogether.  In several cases up and down the Okanogan Valley, homes were severely damaged when the wind blew large trees over onto them.  The Okanogan PUD estimated damage to power lines and poles around $100,000.  Several of the downed power lines sparked wildfires.  (For more on the wildfires, see the separate entries.)

Strong high pressure built up east of the Cascade Mountains by January 5th, which forced frigid air through the Columbia River Gorge into Southwest Washington. A Pacific low pressure system brought moist Pacific air over the top of this cold dome, producing the widespread snow...sleet...and freezing rain throughout the area, and blizzard conditions in Columbia River Gorge. Snowfall totals ranged from 3 inches in Camas to 5 inches at Raymond and Longview, 7 inches in Vancouver, 8 inches in Grays River, and two feet in the South Washington Cascades. Accumulations of up to 2 inches of sleet and freezing rain followed the snowfall. Blizzard conditions in the Columbia River Gorge resulted in the closure of Interstate 84 between Troutdale, Oregon and Hood River Oregon, and Washington State Route 14 between Washougal, Washington and White Salmon, Washington during the same period, halting east-west travel through the Gorge and stranding hundreds of trucks at both ends of the Gorge. Weight from the snow and ice buildup resulted in widespread downed trees and power lines, leaving 2000 customers without power in Clark County. Clark Public Utilities estimated the storm cost between $1 and $1.5 million, while the city of Vancouver estimates  up to $500,000 in damages.",479
