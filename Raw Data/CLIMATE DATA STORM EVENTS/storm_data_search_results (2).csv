Summary of events for March 13 2001:

An upper level low with lots of cold air aloft moved across the Northwest on March 13, bringing unstable conditions to the region.  Meanwhile, a surface low moving across southern British Columbia brought strong sustained gradient winds of 25 to 35 miles an hour to all of eastern Washington that afternoon.  The combination of gradient winds and outflow from otherwise non-suspect showers and thunderstorms was enough to cause wind damage and marginally severe wind gusts.  Most wind damage took place in far eastern Washington, where westerly upslope flow aided in convective development.  For reference, most peak wind gusts and damage described on this date were associated with convective elements.  Damage caused by elements containing cloud-to-ground lightning have been counted as "Thunderstorm Wind" events, while damage caused by elements NOT containing cloud-to-ground lightning have been counted as "High Wind" events.  

Finally, the Alder Ridge RAWS site (at 4500 feet in southern Garfield County) measured a peak wind gust to 63 mph around 500 PM PST outside a thunderstorm.  Though this is significant enough to warrant a mention here, it is not logged as a separate event in Storm Data since high wind criteria are higher for mountain elevations above 3000 feet.",237

A cold front moving into a moist (dewpoints in the mid 50s) and unstable airmass across eastern Washington touched off severe thunderstorms across the Palouse region of far eastern Washington on the afternoon of April 27.  The strongest thunderstorm of the day developed just west of Pullman, moving quickly north-northeast and dropping severe hail from there all the way to the northeast corner of Whitman County.  One other notable thunderstorm (non-severe) developed over southwest Whitman County.  This storm eventually moved north into Spokane County with an unusual display of frequent lightning and many lightning-related power outages.

A shortwave moved over the Inland Northwest on the afternoon and evening of June 27.  Surface dewpoints in the upper 50s and lower 60s helped scattered thunderstorms to develop and move northeast.  The biggest storm of the day developed over the Oregon Cascades and then moved northeast into Washington.  This storm entered Grant County near Priest Rapids Dam, clipping southwest Adams County before passing over Warden.  The storm continued on through the length of Adams County and ended up in southeast Lincoln County.  Along the way, this storm caused marginally severe wind gusts and dumped large hail in excess of the size of quarters.

The "Thirtymile" wildfire was in the mop-up stages on July 10 when excessively hot and dry conditions that afternoon caused the smoldering fire to blow up.  The fire came roaring back to life, quickly spreading from 25 to 2,500 acres in just three hours.  The quickly-spreading fire overran a group of 14 firefighters, causing members of  the group to deploy emergency shelters.  Four members of the group perished (direct), and four others were hospitalized with injuries.  The Thirtymile fire was contained on July 23 after burning a total of 9,300 acres.

Three to five inches of rain caused a significant 100+ year flash flood over the higher terrain of northeast Okanogan County on the evening of July 12.  The weather pattern showed an upper level high pressure ridge over the western United States with monsoonal moisture extending northward into Washington.  Early in the evening, a band of northward-moving thunderstorms developed over northeast Okanogan County which continued to re-generate on its southern flank for 2-3 hours.  Excessive rainfall and flash flooding were the result. 

The worst flash flooding occurred along a stretch of the Oroville-Chesaw Road.  Three separate drainages contributed to the event:  an unnamed creek that flows from Fletcher Mountain, Dry Creek and Tonasket Creek.  A "wall of mud" blasted across Oroville-Chesaw Road where the unnamed creek crosses under the road (one mile east of its intersection with Molson Road), washing a van into the raging creek around 915 PM PDT.  A 56-year old grandmother in the van pushed her granddaughter out in time for the granddaughter to escape injury.  The grandmother could not escape the van and was presumably washed away inside it.  The grandmother is missing and assumed dead (direct).  Her body was never found in the deep mud.  

Significant damage occurred in this rural part of Okanogan County.  Eden Valley Road was completely washed out.  A bridge along Dry Gulch Road was washed out.  Damage to other county roads in the vicinity was extensive.  At the Eden Valley Guest Ranch, fences and other farm implements were washed away.  A grain bin was washed 30 feet away from its foundation.  Water rose high enough to cause damage to parked vehicles.  Mud filled another grain bin, a basement, garage, shop and barn.  Much of the damage in the area was not covered by flood insurance.",297

The high winds knocked over trees, blew down fences, and caused sporadic power outages.  In Wenatchee, a 60-foot tall fir tree toppled over and landed on a house on North Elliott Avenue, causing $15,000 damage.  One tree fell onto a power line on Crawford Street, knocking out power to about 700 homes from Appleyard in south Wenatchee to Stevens Street.  High winds were also responsible for several thousand customers losing power along US Highway 97A from north of Wenatchee to the Stayman Flats area, including Entiat, the Entiat Valley and the Knapp Hill Tunnel.  Other trees blew onto power lines on Atwood and Princton Streets near Wenatchee, and on Wapato Way in Manson.
