The combination of strong dynamic forcing along the shortwave, presence of an abnormally moist, unstable air mass, time of day, highly diffluent flow aloft, and jet streak dynamics led to numerous severe thunderstorms across Eastern Washington.

On the morning of the 20th, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio became ingested into the southerly flow and transported toward the region.  Meanwhile, a shortwave dropping into the Gulf of Alaska acted to kick the upper-low off the southwestern Oregon Coast inland.  The upper-level wave took on a strong negative tilt, driven northeastward by a 75kt jet streak, crossing through Eastern Washington during the early to late afternoon on July 20th.  The combination of strong dynamic forcing along the shortwave, presence of an abnormally moist, unstable air mass, time of day, highly diffluent flow aloft, and jet streak dynamics led to numerous severe thunderstorms across Eastern Washington.  Severe hail, winds, and flash flooding were observed with storms during the early afternoon but the threat transitioned to severe winds by the mid to late afternoon as storms migrated into the Northeastern Mountains.  These storms blew down hundreds of trees causing one fatality.  Ferry and Okanogan Counties were the hardest hit counties and experienced power outages in some remote communities in excess of one week.  Consequently, state and federal assistance was necessary.

Numerous tree limbs were snapped off trees that remain standing.","One of the most widespread severe weather events occurred across the Spokane County Warning Area on July 20th.  Several days prior to the day of the event, a deep upper-level low slowly sagged down the Pacific Northwest Coastline.  Southerly flow ahead of the low pumped moist, unstable air into the Inland Northwest.  The combination of afternoon heating and smaller impulses ejecting from the offshore low kept the region very unsettled with several rounds of severe thunderstorms from the 15th through the 19th.  On the morning of the 20th, the remnants of Tropical Storm Fabio became ingested into the southerly flow and transported toward the region.  Meanwhile, a shortwave dropping into the Gulf of Alaska acted to kick the upper-low off the southwestern Oregon Coast inland.  The upper-level wave took on a strong negative tilt, driven northeastward by a 75kt jet streak, crossing through Eastern Washington during the early to late afternoon on July 20th.  The combination of strong dynamic forcing along the shortwave, presence of an abnormally moist, unstable air mass, time of day, highly diffluent flow aloft, and jet streak dynamics led to numerous severe thunderstorms across Eastern Washington.  Severe hail, winds, and flash flooding were observed with storms during the early afternoon but the threat transitioned to severe winds by the mid to late afternoon as storms migrated into the Northeastern Mountains.  These storms blew down hundreds of trees causing one fatality.  Ferry and Okanogan Counties were the hardest hit counties and experienced power outages in some remote communities in excess of one week.  Consequently, state and federal assistance was necessary.  Preliminary damage figures for Ferry County estimated 2.6 million in debris removal, 1.6 million in emergency protective measures, 128 thousand for road and bridge repair, 570 thousand to building and equipment, 3.2 million for utility repair, and 163 thousand for parks and recreation.  7000 people lost power in Ferry County and three major roads were closed for sometime due to downed trees.  These roads included Highway 21, 97, and 155.  Utility companies estimated 200 downed power poles and 40 miles of line needed restoration.  In Okanogan County, estimations of 82 thousand in debris removal, 36 thousand in emergency protective measures, 180 thousand for road and bridge repair, 419 thousand to building and equipment, 364 thousand for utility repair, and 25 thousand for parks and recreation.

The highway is one of two primary east-west routes through the mountains open during the winter.  About 7,000 to 10,000 drivers cross Stevens Pass during the Christmas holiday.  The 3800 power outages affected the following communities: Plain, Lake Wenatchee, Leavenworth, Mary Canyon, Little Chumstick, Coles's Corner, Kahler Glen, and Fish Lake.  The worst hit locations experienced outages in excess of five days.  Damage costs included 4.6 million dollars from Chelan County PUD, 218 thousand for Chelan County Public Works, and estimated costs for at least fifty houses or cabins damaged and four vehicles.  On December 19th, a tree struck a pickup truck traveling on Chiwawa Loop Road injuring the driver.  On December 21st, a tree struck a car on Highway two thirteen miles east of Stevens Pass killing two adults and injuring four passengers in the SUV.  Two of the four injuries were listed as serious and critical.  On the evening of December 22nd, a 2005 Audi slammed into a newly fallen tree while traveling on Highway 2 roughly 22 miles west of Leavenworth.  All five people inside the vehicle were injured, some seriously.","Several rounds of heavy snow fell across the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades between December 16th and the 24th.  The most significant accumulations occurred with two storm systems; one which moved through the region during the 16th and 17th and second during the 19th and 20th.  These storm systems were addressed in Episodes 69455 and 70424.  Additionally, a Puget Sound Convergence Zone materialized on the afternoon of the 17th dumping an additional foot of snow over the Lake Wenatchee and Plain areas.  Over the seven day period, cumulative snow amounts were as followed: Plain 39.1 inches, Winthrop 28.3 inches, Mazama 36.7 inches, and Holden Village 49.6 inches.  The weight of the snow combined with gusty winds on the 17th resulted in several downed trees.  As snow continued to fall over the next few days, the weight of the snow brought down hundreds of trees which sporadically fell from the 17th through the 24th.  County officials and utility companies were overwhelmed by the amount of power line damage and tree removal necessary and were forced to delay cleanup and repair operations because of unsafe conditions.  The hundreds of downed trees resulted in 3800 power outages, road closures, damage to vehicles, buildings, and utility infrastructure.  Several trees fell on moving cars resulting in at least nine injuries and two deaths.  A majority of the problems occurred within the communities of Lake Wenatchee, Plain, Leavenworth, and along Highway 2 between Leavenworth and Stevens Pass.  It is not uncommon for these locations to experience several days of heavy snow.  What made this event unusual was a combination of factors.  Most important was the temperatures over the entire period which ranged between 28 and 33 Fahrenheit.  Thermal profiles in this range allowed the snow to efficiently stick to the trees.  Secondly, the area never experienced a deep freeze prior to the event.  The unfrozen ground was uanble to hold the trees in place and left the trees vulnerable to snow loading.  Lastly, the combination of the first storm system and local convergence zone brought over two feet of snow within the first 24 to 48 hours followed by an additional foot over the next few days and the lack of winds following the 17th brought no means to blow the snow off the trees.",349

A NWS employee located in the Deep Creek Area also relayed minor roof damage to a neighbor's pole barn. In Cheney, a metal roof was peeled from the top of a mobile home.

The surface low reached a peak intensity of 973 millibars while crossing into Northwestern Washington before gradually weakening and tracking east, northeast along the Canadian Border.  Strong isentropic ascent coupled with orographic flow resulted in heavy wet snow across the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades Sunday evening which shifted into Northeastern Washington overnight into Monday morning.  A strong low-level jet on the eastern periphery of the low ushered a tongue of warm air into Eastern Washington overnight.  This lead from a transition of heavy snow to rain for most locations between Grand Coulee and Spokane.  Snowfall amounts along the Highway 2 corridor from Spokane to Wenatchee ranged from two to six inches.  Snowfall totals across the The East Slopes of the Washington Cascades and northern mountains ranged from six to thirteen inches in the valleys to over a foot in the mountains.  Strong winds also accompanied this storm. The combination of gusty winds and heavy wet snow lead to numerous downed trees in the East Slopes of the Cascades resulting in several road closures and numerous power outages.  The strongest winds were experienced across the West Plains, Palouse, Columbia Basin, and Northeast Mountains.  The winds knocked down a pair of large trees in the Spokane Area and snapped numerous tree limbs resulting in 7300 power outages.",361
